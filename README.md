# This is my Learning Journal
### The aim is to keep track of what I learn about coding daily.

1. Daily Report can be found at **[log.md]()**
2. Small Tasks or Assignments can be found at **[Assignments]()**
3. Projects can be found at **[Projects]()**
4. To-do-Bucket which is a to do list for what I've been following and want to finish them. It can be a book, a course, a article in CSS-TRick
